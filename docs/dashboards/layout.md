## Layout
The layout of your charts on the dashboard can be changed by dragging around
the charts on the canvas. Simply click on the top portion of the graph (where
the title appears) to grab the chart and move it around.

## Sizing
To resize the charts on the dashboard, click and drag using the drag handler in
the bottom right hand corner. Certain charts, such as **Timeseries line** charts
can only be resized down to a minimum size.

## Saving the layout
The layouts (including arrangement and size of charts) is automatically saved
every time you make a change.
